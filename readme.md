## Flair config syntas!
Ok this is what a typical flair/role config at v0.0.1 looks like.
```json
{
    "877562412658462333":{
        "random":{
            "config":{
                "mode": "single"
            },
            "yes":{
                "id": 696969696969696969
            },
            "thing":{
                "id": 420420420420420420
            }
        }
    }
}
```
First, we have this ``"877562412658462333"``, which is just the server ID the roles are in.
The script will scan the config for that.
Then, we have this ``"random"``, which is the group name.
Further into the tree, we have ``"config"``. This defines the mode of the group, i.e. allow only one role per group or more than one.
Then, we have the id. The id is crucial for assigning the roles, since i haven't been able to role stuff properly, lol.

Here i brainstorm my ideas
